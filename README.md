ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Luke-Skynet
-
I am an undergrad student in New York, but I'm originally from Texas.   
My main area of study is CS and Math, and I love anything involving Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or Data Science.  
I primarily use github to store my notes/code from CS classes, but I also like to maintain my own projects here and explore others'.
