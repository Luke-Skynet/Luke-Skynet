ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Luke-Skynet
-
I am an undergrad student in New York, but I'm originally from Texas.   
My main area of study is CS/Stats, and I love anything involving Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or Data Science.  
I like to use github to maintain my projects, and also my notes and assignments from CS classes.
